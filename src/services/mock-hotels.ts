The pool and fitness area looked alrite. The staff was helpful. The bar only offered one type of wine by the glass. We saw a bottle of wine called 'Apothic Red' which cost $12 in Aspen, CO in a bottle shop and about $30 in an expensive restaurant in Aspen. The hotel offered this inexpensive wine for &100?? We had a laugh and ended up having a drink in a different hotel. I would highly recommend hotel nikko in Saigon BUT not in hanoi",
